# Cloud Computing Setup
 Installation of Mosquitto, Node-red and setup of Firewall for linux based server
 
 How to use the setup tool?
 You need to deploy nginx first in order to make all above apps work smoothly.
 First you need to clone the repo, and then run the init.sh file. That's all.

```
adduser username
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
su - username
git clone https://github.com/hanifr/Nginx-Server-Blocks.git
cd Nginx-Server-Blocks
./init.sh
cd https://github.com/hanifr/Cloud-Computing-Setup.git
git clone 
cd /Cloud-Computing-Setup
./init.sh
```
